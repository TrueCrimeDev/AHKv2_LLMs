## Preview the Site Locally

To confirm that the latest homepage layout and blog posts are published, build the Jekyll site and view it in a
browser:

1. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
2. Build & serve: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
3. Open `http://localhost:4000` and check the "Latest site update" card on the homepage—the timestamp will reflect
   the newest post, so you can confirm the content you just added is live.

If you prefer a production build without starting a server, run `bundle exec jekyll build` and inspect the generated
files in `_site/`.
